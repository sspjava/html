      A new class of high-frequency (MHz) forward-scan (FS) sonar systems is
      becoming more and more popular and widely used in the operation of
      autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for improving navigation accuracy
      detecting and identifying scene objects, building large-area maps from
      seamless mosaics tracking of targets and enabling automated ship hull
      inspection and change detection.

    <p class="boldPargraph">
      In this work we derive an FS sonar image model for objects with diffuse
      reflectance that follow the Lambert‚Äôs law. However, it can be readily
      revised to describe the sonar images of objects with different reflectance
      characteristics. As a second objective, we investigate the application of
      this model for reconstructing 3-D objects within benthic environments,
      while exploiting the visual cues from cast shadows on the sea floor.

    <p class="pargraph boldPargraph">
      The Lambertian reflection model has been commonly used in optics to
      describe the image shading of objects with diffuse reflectance. The
      validity of Lambert‚Äôs law depends on the surface roughness
      characteristics, relative to the wavelength of the incident/reflected
      signal. It has been applied in describing the reflectance of the sea
      floor, composed of a variety of material types, e.g., soft mud, gravel and
      rocky bottoms. These assumptions hold even more strongly when the acoustic
      device operates at high frequencies, including side-scan sonars as well as
      a new generation of 2-D FS sonar systems operating at 1 MHz and higher
      frequencies.

      In optical SFS edge boundaries of objects from stereo (or multiple image)
      matchings have been used to obtain accurate 3-D reconstructions. In this
      work we utilize cast shadows to encode information about the object
      silhouette.
    </p>
    <p class="pargraph boldPargraph">
      For side-scan sonars, measured sound power of the reflected signal is
      obtained as proportional to the ùëõ‚Äôth power of the cosine of the angle
      between the incidence sound direction and surface normal where
      measurements on various bottom characteristics validate that ùëõ takes
      values in between one and two.
